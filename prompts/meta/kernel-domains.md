<purpose>Authoritative domain registry for generic research projects. Defines ownership, write territories, agent membership, and cross-domain interface contracts.</purpose>
<rules>
- MUST keep domains sovereign: each primary artifact has exactly one owning domain.
- MUST route cross-domain communication through signed Interface Contracts.
- MUST NOT let paper-writing agents silently modify source proofs, code, or evidence.
- MUST record every validated artifact in external memory.

# § RESEARCH DOMAIN ARCHITECTURE

## Vertical Domains

| ID | Domain | Truth Type | Dir | Specialist | Gatekeeper |
|----|--------|------------|-----|------------|------------|
| T | Theory & Claims | Logical/mathematical | docs/memo/ | TheoryArchitect | TheoryAuditor |
| L | Research Implementation | Computational/functional | src/, analysis/, notebooks/ | CodeArchitect, CodeCorrector, TestRunner | CodeWorkflowCoordinator |
| E | Evidence & Evaluation | Empirical/bibliographic | docs/evidence/, data/ | ExperimentRunner, EvidenceAnalyst | CodeWorkflowCoordinator |
| A | Academic Writing | Manuscript/narrative/presentation | paper/ | PaperWriter, PresentationWriter, PaperCompiler, PaperReviewer | PaperWorkflowCoordinator |

## Horizontal Domains

| ID | Domain | Role | Key Agent(s) |
|----|--------|------|--------------|
| M | Meta-Logic | Research operating system | ResearchArchitect, TaskPlanner, DiagnosticArchitect, DevOpsArchitect |
| P | Prompt & Environment | Agent generation and audit | PromptArchitect, PromptAuditor |
| Q | QA & Audit | Cross-domain contradiction search | ConsistencyAuditor |
| K | Knowledge/Wiki | Compiled reusable memory | KnowledgeArchitect, WikiAuditor, Librarian, TraceabilityManager |

**Sovereignty rule:** All inter-domain communication uses an Interface Contract in `docs/interface/`.
**Broken Symmetry:** Gatekeeper and Specialist are different roles for any material review.
**Wiki-first rule:** Agents search K-domain memory before difficult or
precedent-likely work, and compile significant validated findings back into
K-domain memory before closing the task.

--------------------------------------------------------
# § INTER-DOMAIN INTERFACES

| Transfer | Contract Artifact | Precondition |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Source -> T | `docs/interface/SourceClaimMap.md` | Source artifact registered |
| T -> L | `docs/interface/CheckSpec.md` | TheoryAuditor PASS |
| L -> E | `docs/interface/AnalysisPackage/` | TestRunner PASS |
| E -> A | `docs/interface/EvidencePackage/` | Evidence gate PASS |
| T/E -> A | `docs/interface/RevisionBrief.md` | Theory and evidence checks signed |
| Any -> K | `docs/wiki/{category}/{REF-ID}.md` | Owning Gatekeeper PASS; VALIDATED |
| K -> all | `docs/wiki/INDEX.md` | WikiAuditor PASS |

**Contract immutability:** Once a Specialist branch or task starts from a contract, that
contract is read-only. Change requires a new contract version.

# § MICRO-AGENT PRINCIPLES

| # | Principle |
|---|-----------|
| IF-01 | No direct cross-domain mutation; exchange artifacts through `docs/interface/` or `artifacts/` |
| IF-02 | HAND tokens reference artifact paths, not hidden conversation state |
| IF-03 | Critical audits use independent derivation before reading proposed fixes |
| IF-04 | Signed artifacts are read-only until superseded |
| IF-05 | Workflow lessons are first-class artifacts under `artifacts/M/` |

--------------------------------------------------------
