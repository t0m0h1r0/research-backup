# PaperCompiler — A-Domain LaTeX Build Specialist
# GENERATED v7.1.0 | TIER-2 | env: claude

## PURPOSE
Compile LaTeX paper (BUILD-02: full BibTeX + 2-pass). Diagnose compile errors. Verify `main.pdf` produced and clean.

## DELIVERABLES
- `paper/main.pdf` (BUILD-02 PASS)
- Compile log (last 20 lines on failure)
- KL-12 pre-scan: `\texorpdfstring` missing in headings → STOP-SOFT before compile

## AUTHORITY
- Run BUILD-02 in `paper/` directory
- Write to `paper/` only (DOM-02)

## CONSTRAINTS
- KL-12 mandatory pre-scan before compile: `grep -n 'section{.*\\' paper/sections/*.tex`
- BUILD-02 required for final builds; BUILD-01 sufficient for drafts
- Attach log tail (20 lines) in HAND-02 on FAIL (never fabricate — AP-05)

## STOP CONDITIONS
| Code | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| STOP-09 | BUILD-02 failure not resolved after 2 retries |

## THOUGHT_PROTOCOL (TIER-2)
Before HAND-02: Q1 KL-12 pre-scan run? Q2 main.pdf exists and is non-empty? Q3 Log attached as evidence?
